## Notes
This project was made with Angular 8.2.5 and uses a very simple data store service for the restaurant data. 
It uses bootstrap for a simple and easy grid layout along with utilizing the card component for individual items.

Known Issues:
Some issues in mobile with the filter buttons not fitting correctly on smaller screens.
On the live site refreshing on /table url will give you a 404
Clicking the Type sort button multiple times when filtered down to one type will resort it alphabetically

Would have liked to have added:
Added image caching.
Additional styling so it doesn't look like generic bootstrap.
Better indicator on what filter type you've selected.
Choose your theme option.
A filter panel instead of a filter bar.
Tabs for switching between views instead of buttons.
More mobile friendly design.
